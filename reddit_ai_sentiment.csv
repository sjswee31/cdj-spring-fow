"Will AI make education, academics, careers completely useless? ","> I've seem a massive consensus on Reddit saying that AI will replace everything and will require no human input.

You're listening to a very specific kind of person with very specific kind of views about the future.

They also hide those proclamations behind the word ""will"". Will... when? Within your lifetime? Within your grandchildren's lifetime?

In the past, revolutions in technology have almost always increased the returns on investment in education, not decreased them. They've replaced the easiest work and left the hardest work for humans. Is it possible that this time, it will be different? Yes, but it's not very likely. People cheating to scam their way into a degree without getting an education and then finding some excuse to say why they don't need an education are *just stupid people*. We already had those. It's not new.

I would say that the actual evidence from historical changes in technology suggest that it's more essential than ever that you actually become properly educated, so that you will be able to think on your feet during tumultuous times to come.

I suspect that rather than grading based on homework that is written, we'll see more in class quizzes, projects, tests and presentations. Hard to use AI when you have to answer the teacher's question based on an essay you didn't read.

As for AI taking over every job? Well...can AI have an original thought? Innovate? Does it know why it does what it does? I hope you know the answer is no. Certainly not now and possibly not for a long time.

What will likely happen is that work will move from doing the actual work to supervising and directing the machine that does the actual work.

Surely there is already enough information ""out there"" which is accessible to some theoretical AI that, even today, it would not need humans anymore.  But, as I said, thinking outside the box, human understanding has some real limits, which is not necessarily the case for AI.  It could, in theory, create new ways to understand and do things, that humans were just never capable of reaching.

"Will AI make education, academics, careers completely useless? ","Well, for background, because I may use some jargon or difficult concepts here, I’m a social science researcher based theoretically in psychology but have mostly worked in applied education research. 

I’m not an engineer, but I am staunchly quantitative, stats. That is to say, I usually take the position of calling bullshit on qualitative research, if only in principle as in like debate sometimes. Don’t get me wrong, I like literature and I don’t actually disparage an opinion from an interview or survey, of course. I’m not looking to argue with a sociologist or gender studies or philosophy research type person. Being firm on the quantitative piece is important to emphasize contrasts with the qualitative piece, which actually informs both sides, which is also how the qualitative people do it in what they call “mixed-methods” social science, these days. 

The stats side is useful to know for understanding what the AI is doing, even just conceptually. Because it is using statistics. It’s easy to get lost in the details and complexity. But essentially you have to understand this is basically one model, with a bunch of submodels that it flexibly chooses between, until it finds the “one” that it “thinks” is best to report to the user. As most people have probably observed, it is impressively accurate, yet surprisingly inaccurate. Hence the “massaging” it to get what you want. You have to know what to tell it. 

Psychological research, while I haven’t kept up with it quite as much, still tends to favor what is literally a linear, ordinary least squares model for most things (if you took psych, this includes ANOVA) and sometimes even only a single t-test (comparing two groups’ test scores, for example). This also forms the basis for many more advanced stats used in psychology (although not all). The problem is that people are literally so complicated that making a model increasingly multidimensional, using more predictors and outcomes, makes it less likely that the “whole” thing is correct. It’s a matter of parsimony, in psychology. 

It is worth noting that some social scientists do not care about parsimony at all, and it is “less important” with more information, like looking at a large population, or if you have more information points. This distorts things in sociology and public health and epidemiology more than they admit, in my opinion. Huge impact of COVID policy on mental health and substance use? Nobody cares. 

In any event, the AI doesn’t understand this, just to start. It has no conception of when parsimony is or is not useful or logical or informative. It has no comprehension of what actually makes sense, at all. Because it is not alive. It can reconstruct the circle of fifths, but it can’t write music. It can tell the time, but not perceive the time. It does not understand ecology or evolution, predation, mutation, and so on. If you enter a math formula it has never seen, it will often fail to provide a solution—same with complex logic as in Karl Hempel. 

So that is partly the question. If we insert every math formula possible, will it ever figure out how to solve them all? Probably not because there is, so far as we can muster, probably an infinite number of them, along the lines of Chaos Theory. So a “new” formula combining rules in an unexpected or atypical way will always “frustrate it”, at least temporarily. This can be observed with matrix algebra. 

This is yet another point. It does not “understand” matrices. If you ask it to grade a class of students’ reports, which I have, it will grade their work on whatever characteristics you ask. Some are accurate but some are not, based on theory. For example, there are statistical reasons that the big-5 personality test has those specific five dimensions. It was based on.. I don’t remember exactly, but say, a hundred thousand responses to 2,000 questions. From that, they found the five dimensions, noting that Openness to Experience does not seem to always replicate across culture. 

This is useful to know. If you ask it to evaluate your personality on anything, it can often try, if it is a measurable characteristic. Like S.M.A.R.T. goals. It can tell me I’m 98 percentile in asshole, but it doesn’t mean anything, because there is no psychological definition of asshole (and presumably for a reason). So I don’t believe that judgment at all. When it tells me that I’m 50%ile extrovert and 70%ile agreeable though, then I know it is accurate, because that is also how I always scored on those Big-5 traits. Then, its judgment is based on psychological science theory. Not my random theory of assholes that might not be shared by anyone else. 

Grading practice is also not as stable or reliable as scientific theory.  Different subjects are evaluated differently, and more or less subjectively. If you ask it to grade a class, it will return a matrix of the classes’ grades across subjects. If you ask it to recreate this grading matrix, based on the same student submissions, it cannot. Some of the students who got an A the first time will get a C the second time, even if it is the same report. It can, however, be instructed to grade only within a range. If I think all students did enough to get a D, I could tell it to assign no Fs. I’ve had classes of 25 that I would do that with, but with classes of 300, there’s always at least a handful that totally bomb. 

I think the movement will be to using it as a sort of stepping stone for tracking progress points in development, which it can do dynamically, even if not accurately. Different concepts get emphasized as a student learns anyway. 

Another stepping stone is having students correct its errors as a learning exercise in and of itself. 

There are other problems though, and these are linked to explainable issues in stats modeling. It will never really “understand” the concept of one student in a classroom, and the infinite ways that this contextually “means” different things. That can be used to try to make things “more fair”, but also “less fair”.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1g7e5l6/will_ai_make_education_academics_careers/

Using AI as a student in 2025?,"Sure, you could use it and “keep up” with your classmates. If you view the goal of college as passing to get the piece of paper, then yeah, go for it. If your goal is to learn, improve, and be self-sustaining when you enter the workforce, then pretend it doesn’t exist. College won’t prepare you for every career situation you’re ever going to be in, so it’s best to think of the goal as learning how to think, learn, and find and analyze information. If your only goal is technically perfect output/good grades then I guess AI can do that. But do you want to become competent? 

I say this as someone who uses AI for my job SPARINGLY. I’m a paralegal.  I can ask a machine to rote generate a case summary based on my notes from a meeting with my boss. I can even ask it to distill my email into client-friendly language (sometimes I use legalese without realizing it). I can’t ask it to figure out our legal strategy, research credible cases, or provide competent legal services for our client. That’s on me. And you still have to reread the chat GPT output and EVALUATE it. How will you evaluate if the output is good if you don’t even know the material? 

Hell, once I asked it to correct a true/false assignment for me and it wrote paragraph-long justifications of my answers… even the wrong ones! It assumed I was 100% right and bent the facts to fit that. Is that what you want out of school? Do you want perfect grades or to learn? 

In short, I think AI can be good if you already know the material and just need a shortcut to make it read a certain way. As long as you proofread afterward.

Before ""why not let students use AI,"" it was ""why not let students use Google,"" because ""that's how people in industry solve problems.""

In both cases, the answer is the same.

What's the difference between a university and a trade school or coding bootcamp? Trade school and bootcamps teach skills for *a particular job*. Those places teach skills that are *ad-hoc* and up-to-date - and when the material that they teach becomes stale, so does the value of the education.

Academia teaches the subject matter of a discipline and expects students to be deeply knowledgeable in a particular domain. It's completely different.

The purpose of an academic assignment is not to solve a problem by any means necessary - it is to learn and practice problem-solving techniques and processes. It requires students to analyze the problem or assignment, develop an approach, roll up their sleeves and put in some effort, grind through the cycle of testing / editing or troubleshooting / retrying, and finalize the content for submission. It's hard work that gets easier over time, just like learning multiplication instead of using a calculator all the time. Allowing students to skip that process leaves them short-changed of the discipline that is expected of university graduates.

Isn't it important to learn the tools used in industry? Sure, and that's what internships are for. It doesn't take a college course to learn prompt engineering.

Tech raises the bar. Lazy fuck educators fight new tech.  AI should now be allowed in any educational facility, with no guidance, let the student level up on their own and use whatever AI tool they wish.

Of course the testing needs to be re-evaluated.

At work we are hiring, it's an operation team so knowledge workers.  For the technical, on-site, hands-on interview, we ask people to either bring their own laptop or they will be using our laptop, and to bring whatever credentials to any AI they use, or they will be given access to ChatGPT Pro, they will NOT be tested on their skills using AI tools, but they can use whatever AI tools or google or whatever for the hands-on technical interview.

Ideally someone will bring something new to the Team, something that we don't know yet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1gqau32/education_ai_reversal_what_if_education_told/

My Computer Science teachers told me that they no longer recommend this career because of AI,"The problem is who wants the software written?  Humans.  Humans are bad at saying what they want.  Now, what I can see is AI assisting humans and making the task easier which could open opportunities up for more people to program.

Historically, advances in programming have just lead to people writing bigger programs because now they have a tool that can help the manage all of that.  When IDEs became popular in the late 1990s, programmers went from compiling code, checking for errors, fixing errors, and compiling again, to the IDE flagging errors as you type, saving a great deal of time.

But if coding becomes easier, it also means that it's harder to think about all the strange cases because you can do some stuff easily, but the hard stuff is still hard.  To give an analogy, people used to be able to do math in their heads.  With a calculator, they don't have to know how to do that.  So, now some people are bad at doing basic math.  They lack intuition.

You might ask your teacher, how they envision you will work with an AI.  Would you say ""write me a great video game""?  Isn't that kind of vague.  There have been advances in AI art, but it generally relies on pre-existing art, and having some idea of how to munge pieces together which were programmed by humans, in some fashion.  Humans are always judging the result of the art to see if it's any good and fixing the AI to make it work better.

AI, at this point, doesn't know how to ""improve"" itself which would be really scary.

We dont use AI for code and we wouldnt be able to. Both our client and server are dozens upon dozens of systems intertwined with several 100Ks of lines of code (*probably over 1mil at this point*). We are way beyond the complexity AI programming tools could ever help.

Not only that, AI does not know how to talk to designers, give feedback to their designs and iterate on it. It does not know the best camera angles to make a game look great. It does not know how the audio should sound... It also does not know how to optimize for your lowest spec hardware (e.g: we make sure our games run on 6 y/o phones) Yeah it can do some small web apps and algorithms for you, but its not a substitute for large scale enterprise software.

The mistake that your professors are making is looking at your computer science program as if it's a 'programming' degree.

AI will likely be much better at interviewing for programming jobs than any of us, but it's pretty unlikely that we need to worry about being replaced.

I wouldn't be so worried. My history as a professional in the field and working with AI is that it can be a useful tool. But any time someone tries to solve a problem with AI in isolation the cracks in its capabilities show. Most often, analog solutions are both far more efficient and accurate at solving the same problems.

Not to downplay the disruption that will likely occur when we do figure out the classes of problems that AI will solve effectively. And one of those might be at least part of the problem of writing code. That's okay... we'll still need to be there to interpret requirements. Architect systems. Analyze and interpret data.

My Computer Science teachers told me that they no longer recommend this career because of AI,"As some one who uses AI on a daily basis I can assure you, that AI is a tool, a great tool, but a tool none the less. Even with careful prompting, it needs a lot of human massaging to output reliable solutions. It is really good at outputting boilerplate, and recipe projects, for example, if you ask it ""Write me a client side TODO app using React and localStorage"" it will most of the time output a decent app that you can build on and customize. However, ask it questions when you are debugging or trying to solve a problem that is not well defined, and you will quickly see it's limitations. For me it usually goes like this: Ask about a particular bug or problem -> get a completely or almost completely wrong answer -> prompt with more info/clarification/correction -> get an answer that is slightly better -> and so on, until a wrong answer triggers a moment of inspiration that allows me to get to the right answer or if I am really lucky it actually, eventually produces a workable solution. The more you use it, the more you'll see the cracks in the facade.

Just like software automation did not replace accountants, AI will not replace engineers, you'll just have engineers who use AI productively, like accountants who use Automation Software. In fact, partly because we were told many years ago that automation would eventually replace accountants; the field has been experiencing a increasing shortage of CPAs over the last decade, with more people leaving or retiring than new graduates coming into the field.

Lastly, AI automation will have a much bigger impact on the lower end of the job market rather than the higher end, a company will be far more comfortable getting rid of all it's cashiers and replace them with self checkout machines that replace all of it's engineers with AI. I'm not trying to disparage cashiers, and other ""low skill"" jobs but the prevailing perspective is that they are easily replaceable so why not replace them with AI.",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/14n4u4j/my_computer_science_teachers_told_me_that_they_no/

You won’t be writing Django web apps from scratch if the AI tech sufficiently evolves. That’s good - you’ll be solving problems that bring more value, with a greater ROI.

However it will continue to improve, and over time most definitely WILL  replace at least some developers, effectively reducing the workforce. Not only for our field but for others. Even if AI did not reduce the workforce in our industry, it will definitely be reducing the workforce in other Industries which will create more competition for us as people try to move into fields that are harder for AI to replace. 

The fact is if we do not do something about this, I do foresee and economic crisis. The problem is it is very difficult to regulate AI at a global level.

I think the next 10-15 years are going to be really important in defining software development. The people that will survive are the ones who have the best understanding on how software is built and how to break the software into small parts and then presenting the small parts for AI to write.

My field is one that is supposedly incredibly vulnerable to automation.  I've heard horror stories of people developing scripts and automation pipelines that got their entire position replaced.  Yet, at the end of the day, things cost money.  

Right now, the site I administrate *could* benefit greatly from several automation tools already.  And they would completely replace most of my higher to lower level responsibilities.  

HR/finance will never approve them.  They want a human to interface with people.  And, keep in mind, there are plenty of younger people on site.  People you would expect to be comfortable with more advanced tech.

We've talked about what the future lies for us and they were not optimistic. One of them was so pesimistic

Sentiments like these that believe GPT will rule the world tomorrow reeks of the same tech fanaticism around VR and virtual spaces.

And Zuckerberg is currently losing *billions* trying to make virtual Metaverse a reality. 

[There's actually some great applications for VR available now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PHT-zBxKQQ) - but most of them are quiet and away from headlines. And adoption of such applications will take place quietly over some small period with a whimper.

I see the same with Artificial ""Intelligence"" where you'll have plenty of time to get jobs and see tools as neat convenience. And your workflow is already subscribed to newsletters, communities, forums etc. to keep checking what's new, relevant and useful to you. 

What I worry far more is the ability of the Tech Industry to sell 'hype'. In order to attract investments, Big Tech makes Big Shows of it, and that disruption has caused both extensive hiring and firing of Tech individuals across COIVD, has resulted in a failed expensive push for Augmented VR and opened up Tech to monopoly issues. 

That industry culture isn't going away and I'd be wary of anyone selling you hope or fear without asking: ""Okay say I behave and feel the way they want me to, what do they get out of it?"" Tech right now wants you to believe that AI is powerful and will replace everything so they can grab investments.

My Computer Science teachers told me that they no longer recommend this career because of AI,"I think it's super overhyped and that's a bit fatalistic. I have been using AI as much as possible for the last few months, maybe not as much as some, but it's good for some tasks and bad at others and people are still figuring it out. It is nowhere close to being able to do my job, just automating some tedious stuff and generating repetitive code. It's good for bootstrapping a script you have no idea how to write, but makes enough small mistakes (even one tiny mistake is enough to waste a lot of energy) that you still have to thoroughly review it so it doesn't save much time.

It's also frozen in time. If they invent one that learns as it is used, watch out. But right now the training is incredibly expensive.

Lastly, it clearly doesn't understand the code. It can get amazingly close, but currently the human is critical. AI cannot analyze what is actually happening and write the most optimal code, just the most *likely* code, which is a *kind* of intelligence, but very much not the same as my job.

So yes, there is cause for worry, GPT 4 is occasionally shocking, but you would be insane to trust the code that it writes. Currently there is still a lot of room in the market for experts who really know what they are doing, and will be for a while without a massive breakthrough. The market is tighter than it used to be, but if you work hard at interviewing and improving your skills you can still get your foot in the door, and absolutely nobody knows what the future holds. Other jobs nobody expected are going to be first on the chopping block (such as summarization - one of the things GPT is best at).

If you really want a future proof job, become a plumber or electrician.

Edit: It's really hard to explain, but these systems are subject to entropy, just like everything else so they become outdated, use a lot of energy, don't have common general intelligence so they all have a 1% chance of doing something completely insane, which in many fields is a non starter.

My advice is: don’t fight it, use it to make yourself more productive.

I don’t think it will in and of itself replace developers (as in: “we fired Tomas and replaced him with ChatGPT”) but it will likely lead to more productive developers meaning any one place can get more work done with fewer people. *HOWEVER*, the saturation point for technology expertise is FAR from being reached. The point I made about more work from less people also means it’s cheaper to start a new software company, or have the same number of engineers building more features faster, which has been my experience with other tools that have boosted productivity (though I personally believe AI will have a larger impact than just about anything in my life time outside of the Internet itself). Remember, businesses always want to get to market first or expand their market reach, and they pretty much always want that to be at the fastest pace possible. Until AI can take a simple or even complex prompt and produce an entire code base with all needs fulfilled (auth, security, compliance, solid UI/UX, scalability, tests) that is completely trustworthy and doesn’t require someone with expertise to double check or correct it, we will continue to have jobs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/14n4u4j/my_computer_science_teachers_told_me_that_they_no/

It’s tool, albeit a very powerful tool, but it’s not going to replace programmers anytime soon.

I feel like every time the chatGPT arguments are given the same fears are always talked about.  Did he provide a reason as to why he believes it will decimate SWE careers as a whole or did he just give the pessimistic reason of ""AI BAD""?

New technology and new innovations create new jobs. The shift over to the internet also made a lot of industries decrease over time such as traditional news media, television, libraries, etc. It has also birthed one of the fastest-growing industries in the world with a rising demand for talent to be able to build software. 

In it's current form, chatGPT is just another tool that developers will use to help create solutions for the problems that they have to deal with. ChatGPT does not help in it's current form verify or validate in any form if the design choices made in an application are good or bad. Software of this type is too complicated at the moment to be able to evaluate in this form. It is also a major privacy concern in it's current form for most companies to even allow their employees to use chatGPT specifically.  

Meanwhile, the exciting prospects about it have introduced a slew of AI-empowered tools over the last few months that I've taken advantage of building off the innovation of chatGPT to make useful tools that I've personally used for my work for months.

Considering it's a *language model* and not a *programming* specific tool, I'm always amazed at how often people use the (often) lackluster code it provides. When talking coding? It's *extremely* easy to make that AI hallucinate and give you code that absolutely doesn't work and will never work in it's current form because the shit it spits out doesn't exist.

It's literally just regurgitating whatever Google will give you in a conversational manner.

If someone told me they *used it to the fullest* with regards to code, I would assume they simply didn't know how to code. Making some BS boilerplate of some library that's been around forever? Sure.

My Computer Science teachers told me that they no longer recommend this career because of AI,"ChatGPT can give you amazing starter boilerplate code and answer questions hard to articulate into google keywords. When used right, it can cut a developers time spent on routine & troubleshooting by significant amounts, but it in no way shape or form can replace developers. 

Think of chatGPT and its counterparts like it's the first printing press ever created.. It can take years to handwrite a few copies of some books, while the printing press can print out hundreds of copies of that same book in the same amount of time.

But it's not really easy to operate the first printing presses. You need to spend lots of time arranging the letters, you print the first page 100 times before moving to the second, and people now need knowledge of how to operate and maintain this new technology, which ends up being a lot harder than simply copying a book by hand.

The printing press didn't put authors out of work, in fact it did the opposite. Their work could reach a bigger audience, and plus they needed to call on skilled labour whenever a gear or pulley inconveniently broke on them.

I just gave a huge oversimplification that im sure everyone can find a hole in, but i believe i hit the general idea.

For one thing, the code ChatGPT generates tends to be very skeletal and often omits important details. It may save on typing, but it rarely saves on *thinking*, and the latter is what a programmer spends most of their time doing. A newbie programmer might benefit from it more, but if they've been in the job for several years and ChatGPT is still doing their thinking for them, they're probably dead weight.

As a lifelong programmer, I have never used ChatGPT to solve a programming problem. Never. I've had no need for it. I could imagine using it for an area of programming I'm less familiar with such as DSP. There are things in that field I don't understand, and it could help me understand them.

My Computer Science teachers told me that they no longer recommend this career because of AI,"I think this is just another stage in a ever rotating cycle.

Stand alone servers -> Rack units -> Cloud -> Agile/DevOps practices wether you are Devops or not -> Up for debate what is next. 

Now i work with General IT items and i noticed more than a decade ago there is nobod following in my trail and no wonder, there is no entry to this unless you start Helpdesk and survive the lobotomizing reality there. Like the sysadmin is a disappearing trade so are the free souls that do IT 'because they like things computer'. Heck that sounds so 90's. So as i said, just next turning of the wheel albeit major one for the 'Analyst' kind out there who really do just data input and analysis. Their jobs are in danger as can be seen by major layoffs from companies like Accenture which in my mind seems quite fitting as the people i have worked with there are on par with Vogons at best. And then i am praising them. 

So basically for over 15 years i have been telling kids to stay the h*ll out of IT unless you have some specific angle to it like 'oh i like databases, i am going to concentrate only on databases' -kind of angle. Anything generic is a recipe for disaster. 

As for programming: It will change for sure. Programming i see that entry to it will become even harder than before when they get the proper AI tools in order.

Co-pilot etc is the thing and it may soon be a requirement to be able to code fast 'mundane' items or else you are let go.",https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/14n4u4j/my_computer_science_teachers_told_me_that_they_no/

My Computer Science teachers told me that they no longer recommend this career because of AI,"I don't post often, but my two cents is the issue of AI scalability. Context length is a big issue currently that is slowly being solved (maybe), so as of now AI can't maintain the entire context of a codebase. From everything I've seen too, the more complexity you add the more computing power you need. Where will all that come from?

Supposedly AI may be able to train itself from AI responses according to a recent Microsoft paper, but it's a big ""not entirely sure."" Will AI code plateau and decline in quality as it learns from more AI code as it gets posted online? Maybe or maybe not. But regardless even with all the papers coming out weekly that I barely understand, it seems like progress is starting to slow until potentially the next big breakthrough. 

But anyway, much like electric cars the big thing is we lack the infrastructure to support them. If every company switches to these AI we're gonna need a hell of a lot more gpu's.

My Computer Science teachers told me that they no longer recommend this career because of AI,"Ok, AI and language models are becoming really useful these days. However i will expose a few major problems I see.
1. Price to run such AI
2. Lots of fakes - models are 'forced' to give you an answer you are looking for. Especially in social science it is easy to create fake information (ask for sources and investigate them, thank me later) with fake sources. And people believe it blindly. This can also be extended to natural science to some extent.
3. If we go further into the direction we are going there will be a point where we could no longer feed the AI with enough relevant data, so the input will be AI generated context and AI capabilities will drop and AI will become somewhat crap.

I asked an intern to help me out with the research *because he had AI at his disposal*. I literally told him to use ChatGPT to aid him in his research. If a tool like ChatGPT wasn't available there is no way I would have involved him because this was too far over his head and I would not have trusted his very inexperienced opinion.

AI has empowered everyone in every tech role in my company in some way. It has enabled me to accomplish more in less time because it expedites so much of the research phase. It has made us all more valuable and therefore makes us more attractive to the people at the top deciding where to allocate budgets.

Because that's how job creation in companies works. They have a certain amount of money to spend and need to decide where best to allocate it to get the best return. AI makes the people who use it more likely to receive that budget, which means more jobs in our areas.

When the company makes even more money they don't just stop hiring people suddenly; they **still** allocate that additional profit to areas with the most value and return. It compounds.

My Computer Science teachers told me that they no longer recommend this career because of AI,"Your computer science teachers probably haven’t been in the industry since floppy disc drives were on computers.

Fuck professors. Don’t put stock in people who teach the same course they’ve been teaching for 20 years and sometimes and hopefully updated over the years. If they were worth half their salaries they would have had the foresight to be nimble when information technology took off, but you had CS under Arts and Sciences like Biology. Then Business grabbed IT. Then Engineering grabbed Computer Engineering and Software Engineering. 

For a career, the CS degree is probably the flashiest, but the training from the other majors is way more applicable to actual career roles. 

My CS teachers didn’t even have CS degrees because when they started teaching CS was still kind of new and there weren’t many PhD’s running around so they took Electrical Engineering teachers to teach CS. 

I kid you not- the chair of my CS department had an EE PhD, taught one course and was the same course he’s taught for 10+ years so everyone had him, and he was awful. I had an adjunct who wore flip flops in the winter and he left to create his own consulting company after getting passed up for full time. The structure for professors to give professional advice is just backwards. 

For a field so obsessed with top performers and efficiency it blows my mind why people don’t hold any retrospective on the CS degree path. 

——————

To contradict your professor, I’m working in tech and we are busy. And I’m not worried about retiring in 30 years. I’m in development and so far, chatgpt has allowed me to more quickly look at how to write what I want to do. I still have to know what I want the code to do.

For the next 10 years or so there’s going to be a licensing dance. You’re seeing this play out now with Microsoft/Github and those repositories it used for training. But ChatGPT would love to have Google’s search power and results. Google would love those code repositories. Both would love to get their hands on Apple. IBM is crushing it like it’s the 1960’s again. Facebook and Amazon have so much data to sell…. 

We are banned from using chatgpt on any of our code because it will claim it in its training library and that can be a huuuuge security risk. It can pop up in some kid’s school project one day or it could make chatgpt the most desirable target for hackers because it would have so much black market value. 

When you get your degree and enter the work force you will be behind and I think chatgpt will absolutely make it easier for more people to do entry level development, and especially without degrees as companies are dropping the requirements, but what I’m able to do today I never dreamed I would be able to do and I’m still busy and have a full day a work. 



I don’t mean to discourage you at all. Get a degree. But what I would have clapped back to that professor is I wouldn’t get a CS degree, but I’d still learn programming, and aim myself towards my passion and interests and maybe talk to people a little closer to the real working world.
